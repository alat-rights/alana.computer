Hi! I'm Alana.

My goal is to make the future awesome. I currently do AI safety research.

In the past, I have:
- Built systems to catch bad actors for WhatsApp
- Conducted pre-release safety testing on GPT-4 for ARC Evals (now METR)
- Studied worst-case risks from AI at the Center on Long-Term Risk
- Conducted research on the AI alignment problem with Vivek Hebbar via the MATS program

These days, I think about:
- How to test, monitor, secure, and contain powerful future AI systems
- How to build infrastructure and tooling that speed up researchers
- The inner lives of transformers

You might want to...

- Keep up with my every move on [GitHub](https://github.com/alat-rights).
