**Update:**
**I am joining Magic AI as a Member of Technical Staff!!**

Hi! I'm Alana.

My goal is to make the future awesome.

Currently, I do this by building LLM evals at Magic.dev.

I'm on a leave of absence from Stanford University, where I studied Computer Science.

In the past, I have:
- Built systems to catch bad actors for [WhatsApp](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1805617343145907)
- Conducted [pre-release safety testing on GPT-4](https://metr.org/blog/2023-08-01-new-report/) for ARC Evals (now [METR](https://metr.org/blog/2023-12-04-metr-announcement/))
- Studied worst-case risks from AI at the [Center on Long-Term Risk](https://longtermrisk.org/)
- Conducted research on the AI alignment problem with Vivek Hebbar via the [MATS program](https://www.matsprogram.org/)

If you're in Tokyo or San Francisco, I'd love to meet up. I'm always looking to make new friends.
